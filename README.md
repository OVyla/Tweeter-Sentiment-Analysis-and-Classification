# Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Classification

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis and classification on Twitter data. It was developed as part of the "Aprenentatge Computacional" (Computational Learning) course at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models capable of classifying tweets based on their sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) or other specific categories.

## Dataset

*   **Source:** [Describe where the data came from, e.g., Twitter API, Kaggle dataset]
*   **Description:** The dataset contains [Number] tweets labeled with [Labels].
*   **Preprocessing:** Steps taken to clean the data include:
    *   Removing URLs, mentions, and hashtags.
    *   Tokenization and lemmatization.
    *   Stopword removal.

## Methodology

The project explores several machine learning algorithms, including:

1.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   Bag of Words (BoW)
    *   TF-IDF
    *   Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
2.  **Models:**
    *   Naïve Bayes
    *   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   [Any Deep Learning models if applicable, e.g., LSTM, BERT]

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tweeter-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Classification.git
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the main script to train the models or perform inference:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Model A | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| Model B | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
